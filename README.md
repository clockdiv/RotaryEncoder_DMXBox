# RotaryEncoder_DMXBox
a small machine with rotary encoders to controll DMX devices

* PCB created in KiCad 5.1.9
* Code written in vscode with PlatformIO
* based on the Teensy 3.2 Project by pjrc.com

## Basic function
The values of the rotary encoders are mapped to specific DMX channels. The idea is to create a device for interactive stages like e.g. a pully hanging from the ceiling to control moving lights or similiar with it.
